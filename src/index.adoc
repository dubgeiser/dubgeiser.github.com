== {url-vimconfig}[vimconfig]
[.lead]
My Vim configuration.

I've been using Vim as my main editor for quite a while; Going through the SQL dump of a an ancient blog of mine, I ran into a statement for inserting data in the `blog_post`, title: "Going Vim", date: "2004-11-25 12:05".

== {url-tilde}[tilde]
[.lead]
My dotfiles.

I rely on Bash and the usual command line tools and started putting my preferences in git around 2013. I switch to a 1 shell + tmux flow every now and again, but I seem to be always going back to MacVim + iTerm2; the copy-paste just works how I like it and I'm a sucker for pretty colors and italic code comments.

== {url-mbinstall}[mbinstall]
[.lead]
Semi-automatically installation of my MacBook (This should be replaced by something Ansible-based)

== {url-knife}[knife]
[.lead]
PHP Code collection, geared towards developing with {url-fork}[Fork CMS].

NOTE: Knife isn't maintained anymore, the repo is archived.
