      <p>My vim configuration.</p>
      <p>I've been using Vim as my main editor for quite a while; Going through the SQL dump of a an ancient blog of mine, I ran into a statement for inserting data in the `blog_post`, title: "Going Vim", date: "2004-11-25 12:05".</p>

      <h3><a href="https://github.com/dubgeiser/tilde">tilde</a></h3>
      <p>My dotfiles.</p>
      <p>I rely on Bash and the usual command line tools and started putting my preferences in git around 2013.  I switch to a 1 shell + tmux flow every now and again, but I seem to be always going back to MacVim + iTerm2; the copy-paste just works how I like it and I'm a sucker for pretty colors and italic code comments.</p>
